# Basic desires for the language

1. Split-S active-stative alignment
2. Purely 'fluid' consonant inventory (e.g. no stops)
3. Verbs heavily agglutinative, but nouns only lightly
    1. Affix for specifying how the speaker feels about the sentence, with a standalone form
4. Heavy reliance on spatial prepositions
5. Generally AVP word order (agent-verb-patient) in basic prose
6. Avalent verbs are frowned upon, e.g. don't say *It rains* but rather *The rain falls*

# Writing System

Consonants form the background and are based on geologic/geographical features:
1. The iconic peak (smooth sides)
2. The snowcapped iconic peak (smooth sides)
3. The craggy peak (bumpy sides)
4. The snowcapped craggy peak (bumpy sides)
5. The butte (bumpy sides)
6. The hill
7. The spire
8. The canyon
9. The two-point peak
10. The three-point peak
11. The balanced rock
12. The volcano
13. The rolling hills
14. The plateau
15. The arch
16. The cave
17. The valley
18. The terrace
19. The erupting volcano
20. The saddle
21. The dunes

Sometimes, an extra 'consonant' that has no vocalization called 'The Plain', is used in writing. This occurs when a vowel is proceeded by another vowel.

Vowels are arbitrary marks and symbols inscribed underneath the consonant that precedes them.

ii (= ee)
i (= ih) (+ r) (here)
y (= French y) (+ r) (yeah...)
a (= ah) (+ r)  (arrr, matey)
ae (= aa)
e (= eh) (+ r) (where)
u (= uh) (+ r) (durr)
o (= oh without rounding) (+ r) (more)
oo (= ooo) (+ r) (sewer)

Some vowels have an 'r-colored' variant.

## Dipthongs

e-ii
a-ii
o-oo (heavier than General American English)
a-oo
o-ii

## Syllable construction

(I)V(T)

R-colored vowels followed by another vowel are not permissible, or always analyzed as (C)VrV

V = all vowels and dipthongs
I = consonants - (ng, ch, gh)
T = consonants - (h, j, r, w, wh)

Letters generally reserved for inflectionary purposes:

h, y
