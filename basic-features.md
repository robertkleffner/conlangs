# Basic desires for the language

1. Split-S active-stative alignment
2. Purely 'fluid' consonant inventory (e.g. no stops)
3. Verbs heavily agglutinative, but nouns only lightly
    1. Affix for specifying how the speaker feels about the sentence, with a standalone form
4. Heavy reliance on spatial prepositions
5. Generally AVP word order (agent-verb-patient) in basic prose
6. Avalent verbs are frowned upon, e.g. don't say *It rains* but rather *The rain falls*

# Writing System

Consonants form the background and are based on geologic/geographical features:
1. The iconic peak (smooth sides)
2. The snowcapped iconic peak (smooth sides)
3. The craggy peak (bumpy sides)
4. The snowcapped craggy peak (bumpy sides)
5. The butte (bumpy sides)
6. The hill
7. The spire
8. The canyon
9. The two-point peak
10. The three-point peak
11. The balanced rock
12. The volcano
13. The rolling hills
14. The plateau
15. The arch
16. The cave
17. The valley
18. The terrace
19. The erupting volcano
20. The saddle
21. The dunes

Sometimes, an extra 'consonant' that has no vocalization called 'The Plain', is used in writing. This occurs when a vowel is proceeded by another vowel.

Vowels are arbitrary marks and symbols inscribed underneath the consonant that precedes them.

## Vowels

ii (= ee)
i (= ih) (+ r) (here)
y (= French y) (+ r) (yeah...)
a (= ah) (+ r)  (arrr, matey)
ae (= aa)
e (= eh) (+ r) (where)
u (= uh) (+ r) (durr)
o (= oh without rounding) (+ r) (more)
oo (= ooo) (+ r) (sewer)

Some vowels have an 'r-colored' variant.

## Dipthongs

e-ii
a-ii
o-oo (heavier than General American English)
a-oo
o-ii

## Syllable construction

(I)V(T)

R-colored vowels followed by another vowel are not permissible, or always analyzed as (C)VrV

V = all vowels and dipthongs
I = consonants - (ng, ch, gh, wh)
T = consonants - (h, j, r, w, wh)

'wh' is reserved for inflectionary purposes.

# Affixes

## Noun Marking

Noun stems never end in an r-colored vowel.

1. Plural: default singular + (zero, some, many, most, all)
    1. singular = unmarked
    2. zero = *-o/-jo*
    3. some = *-ī/-jī*
    4. many = *-ing/-jing*
    5. most = *-ir/-jir*
    6. all = *-adhu/-jadhu*
2. Morphosyntactic: default patientive + (agentive, receptive (He gave a book *to me*), benefactive, causative)
    1. patientive = unmarked
    2. agentive = *-eī,-heī*
    3. receptive = *-ul,-l*
    4. benefactive = *-nū*
    5. causative = *-vāī,-fāī*    (must match the voicedness of the consonant preceding, otherwise *-vāī*)
3. Definiteness: default indefinite + (the, this, that)
    1. a = unmarked
    2. the = *u-,uwh-*
    3. this = *ny-,nywh-*
    4. that = *vā-,vāwh-*

Structure: (definite) + root + (morphosyntactic) + (plural)

Benefactive: action was done with someone in mind, for someone's benefit, or on someone's behalf
Receptive: all other indirect objects

### Subclass: Mountain/Peak/Hill/Butte/Other elevated geographical features related to hiking and climbing

Based on the Glacier Mountaineering Society 'Climb Classification System'.

1. Average rating: default class 1 + (classes 2 - 6)
2. Maximum rating: default class 1 + (classes 2 - 6)
3. Round trip distance: default short + (medium, long)
4. Elevation gain: default short + (medium, long)
5. Route type: default ridge + (face, slope, couloir)
6. Approach direction: default unspecified + (north, south, east, west)
7. Traverse
8. Snow and/or ice climb

## Pronoun Marking

1. Plural: default singular + (zero, some, many, most, all)
2. Morphosyntactic: default patientive + (agentive, receptive, benefactive, causative)

Pronouns vary in the root by:
1. Person
2. Sex (he, she, non-specified)

## Verb Marking

1. Evidentiality: default witness + (inferential, hearsay, quotative, participatory, faith)
2. Primary aspect: default stative + (perfective, habitual, progressive)
3. Secondary aspects: default none + (inchoative, cessative) + (frequentative (only active)) + (durative) + (simultaneous)
4. Mood: default indicative + (interrogative, imperative, jussive, permissive, conditional, desiderative, optative)
5. Voice: default standard + (reflexive, reciprocal)

Note: evidentiality should only be used with realis moods (e.g. indicative)

### Non-finite Forms

1. Infinitive
2. Gerund

A participle can be formed with the essive preposition + gerund

## Adjective Marking

1. Comparative: default no-comparison + (least cool, less cool, more cool, most cool, as cool as, more cool than, less cool than, -ish)

## Adverb Marking

1. Comparative: default no-comparison + (less often, more often)

# Derivational Morphology

1. Adjective -> Noun : "strong" -> "strength", names the quality
2. Verb -> Noun, Adjective -> Noun : "climb" -> "climber", "evil" -> "enemy", performs the act, subject has the quality
3. Verb -> Noun : "go" -> "departure", an instance of the act
4. Noun -> Noun : "mountain" -> "mountain range", pluralization
5. Noun -> Noun : "rock" -> "boulder", augmentative
6. Noun -> Noun : "rock" -> "pebble", diminutive
7. Verb -> Noun : "cut" -> "saw", tool used to speed up or perform an act
8. Noun -> Adjective, Verb -> Adjective : "water" -> "wet", "fall" -> "unstable", having the quality of, liable to

# Expressing Tense

Sometimes it is clear from the context which tense is meant. Sometimes a specific or relative time is referenced. For the rest of the cases, there are three short words that can be used to specify tense. These short words can also be used to form a copula.
