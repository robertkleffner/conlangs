# Basic desires for the language

1. Split-S active-stative alignment
2. Purely 'fluid' consonant inventory (e.g. no stops)
3. Verbs heavily agglutinative, but nouns only lightly
    1. Affix for specifying how the speaker feels about the sentence, with a standalone form
4. Heavy reliance on spatial prepositions
5. Generally AVP word order (agent-verb-patient) in basic prose
6. Avalent verbs are frowned upon, e.g. don't say *It rains* but rather *The rain falls*

# Writing System

Consonants form the background and are based on geologic/geographical features:
1. The iconic peak (smooth sides)
2. The snowcapped iconic peak (smooth sides)
3. The craggy peak (bumpy sides)
4. The snowcapped craggy peak (bumpy sides)
5. The butte (bumpy sides)
6. The hill
7. The spire
8. The canyon
9. The two-point peak
10. The three-point peak
11. The balanced rock
12. The volcano
13. The rolling hills
14. The plateau
15. The arch
16. The cave
17. The valley
18. The terrace
19. The erupting volcano
20. The saddle
21. The dunes

Sometimes, an extra 'consonant' that has no vocalization called 'The Plain', is used in writing. This occurs when a vowel is proceeded by another vowel.

Vowels are arbitrary marks and symbols inscribed underneath the consonant that precedes them.

# Phonology

## Consonants

21 total

m
n
ng
ch - gh
s - z
sh - zh
th - dh
h
j
l (only inflectionary)
t (flapped 'r' sound)
ll (only in sandhi)
rr (only in sandhi)
f - v
w - wh

## Vowels

ii (= ee) (+r) (here)
y (= French y) (+ r) (yeah...)
a (= ah) (+ r)  (arrr, matey)
e (= eh) (+ r) (where)
u (= uh) (+ r) (durr)
o (= oh without rounding) (+ r) (more)
oo (= ooo) (+ r) (sewer)
i

## Dipthongs

e-ii
a-ii
e-oo
a-oo
o-ii

## Coloration

All vowels monophthongs have an r-colored and l-colored variant, except for *i*, which only has an l-colored variant.

## Syllable construction

(I)V(T)

R-colored vowels followed by another vowel are not permissible, or always analyzed as (C)VrV

V = all vowels and dipthongs
I = consonants - (ng, ch, gh, l)
T = consonants - (h, j, r, w, wh, l)

R-colored and l-colored vowels are **only** used for inflectionary purposes.
The consonant *l* and the vowel *i* are **only** used for inflectionary purposes.
Roots never begin with *wh*.

## Sandhi

*-rt-* ==> *-rr-* rolled
*-lt-* ==> *-lh-* Welsh 'll'
*-ll-* ==> *-llh-* voiced Welsh 'll'

# Affixes

All noun roots end in a vowel, which specifies the class. Nouns roots also must have at least 2 syllables, except for the special words for *peak*, *butte*, and *hill*.

## Noun Marking

1. Plural (type affix): default singular + (zero, some, many, most, all)
    1. singular = unmarked
    2. zero = *-meng*
    3. some = *-mī*
    4. many = *-mo*
    5. most = *-ma*
    6. all = *-mū*
2. Morphosyntactic (type infix): default patientive + (agentive, receptive (He gave a book *to me*), benefactive, causative)
    1. patientive = unmarked
    2. agentive = final vowel colored *r*
    3. receptive = final vowel colored *l*
    4. benefactive = first vowel of root + final vowel colored *l*
    5. causative = first vowel of root + final vowel colored *r*
3. Definiteness (type prefix): default indefinite + (the, this, that)
    1. a = unmarked
    2. the = *lu-,l-*
    3. this = *ly-,lywh-*
    4. that = *lo-,lowh-*

Benefactive: action was done with someone in mind, for someone's benefit, or on someone's behalf
Receptive: all other indirect objects

### Subclass: Mountain/Peak/Hill/Butte/Other elevated geographical features related to hiking and climbing

These suffixes occur before the pluralizers. The order they occur in is as enumerated.

1. Estimated technicality (mandatory): easy, medium, hard = *-līl*, *-lol*, *-laīl*
2. Estimated arduousness (mandatory): easy, medium, hard = *-vī*, *-vo*, *-vaī*
3. Coolness/beauty factor (mandatory): lame, decent, cool dude = *-cī*, *-co*, *-caī*
4. Need ropes (optional) = *-thu*
5. Need snow/ice gear (optional) = *-wig*

## Pronoun Marking

1. Plural: default singular + (zero, some, many, most, all)
2. Morphosyntactic: default patientive + (agentive, receptive, benefactive, causative)

Same as noun marking because I'm a bore

Pronouns vary in the root by:
1. Person (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
2. Sex in the 3rd (he, she, mix, inan)

*caī* = 'I'             *caīmeng* = 'none of us'        *carīmeng* = 'none of us (agt.)'
*dhī* = 'you'           *dhīmeng* = 'none of you'       *dhīrmeng* = 'none of you (agt.)'
*zhe* = 'he'            *zhemeng* = 'none of them'      *zhermeng* = 'none of them (agt.)'
*ije* = 'she'           *ijemeng* = 'none of them'      *ijermeng* = 'none of them (agt.)'
*zao* = 'mix'           *zaomeng* = 'none of them'      *zaromeng* = 'none of them (agt.)'
*ate* = nonspecified    *atemeng* = 'none of them'      *arremeng* = 'none of them (agt.)'

## Verb Marking

All verb stems have at least 2 consonants except for the copula *soīvu*.

1. Evidentiality: default witness + (inferential, hearsay, quotative, participatory, faith)
2. Primary aspect: default stative + (perfective, habitual, progressive)
3. Secondary aspects: default none + (inchoative, continuative, cessative) + (frequentative (only active))
4. Mood: default indicative + (interrogative, imperative, jussive, permissive, conditional, desiderative, optative)

Note: evidentiality should only be used with realis moods (e.g. indicative)

### Non-finite Forms

Each verb can be classified with it's gerund form according to three types.

2. Gerund
    1. type 1 = *-eīvu*
    2. type 2 = *-aīvu*
    3. type 3 = *-oīvu*

A present participle can be formed with the pertingent preposition + gerund
A past participle can be formed with the subessive preposition + gerund
A future participle can be formed with the superessive preposition + gerund
An infinitive can be formed with the inessive preposition + gerund

## Adjective Marking

1. Comparative: default no-comparison + (least cool, less cool, more cool, most cool, as cool as, more cool than, less cool than, -ish)
    1. -ish = *-ly*

## Adverb Marking

1. Comparative: default no-comparison + (less often, more often)

# Derivational Morphology

1. Adjective -> Noun : "strong" -> "strength", names the quality
2. Verb -> Noun, Adjective -> Noun : "climb" -> "climber", "evil" -> "enemy", performs the act, subject has the quality
3. Verb -> Noun : "go" -> "departure", an instance of the act
4. Noun -> Noun : "mountain" -> "mountain range", grouping and singularizing
5. Noun -> Noun : "rock" -> "boulder", augmentative
6. Noun -> Noun : "rock" -> "pebble", diminutive
7. Verb -> Noun : "cut" -> "saw", tool used to speed up or perform an act
8. Noun -> Adjective, Verb -> Adjective : "water" -> "wet", "fall" -> "unstable", having the quality of, liable to
9. Adjective + Noun -> Noun : "high" + "peak" -> "pinnacle", applies the modifier to the noun and makes a word out of it
                                                            generally used with (noun -> adjectives) with *-ly*, i.e. (oniony-man = ogre)

# Expressing Tense

Sometimes it is clear from the context which tense is meant. Sometimes a specific or relative time is referenced. For the rest of the cases, there are three short words that can be used to specify tense. These short words can also be used to form a copula.
