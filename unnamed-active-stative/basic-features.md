# Basic desires for the language

1. Split-S active-stative alignment with active being default in intransitive, patientive used to specify voltion/effects
2. Purely 'fricafluid' consonant inventory (e.g. no stops)
3. Verbs heavily agglutinative, but nouns only lightly
4. Heavy reliance on spatial prepositions
5. Generally AVP word order (agent-verb-patient) in basic prose
6. Avalent verbs are frowned upon, e.g. don't say *It rains* but rather *The rain falls*

# Writing System

Consonants form the background and are based on geologic/geographical features:
1. The iconic peak (smooth sides)
2. The snowcapped iconic peak (smooth sides)
3. The craggy peak (bumpy sides)
4. The snowcapped craggy peak (bumpy sides)
5. The butte (bumpy sides)
6. The hill
7. The spire
8. The canyon
9. The two-point peak
10. The three-point peak
11. The balanced rock
12. The volcano
13. The rolling hills
14. The plateau
15. The arch
16. The cave
17. The valley
18. The terrace
19. The erupting volcano
20. The saddle
21. The dunes

Sometimes, an extra 'consonant' that has no vocalization called 'The Plain', is used in writing. This occurs when a vowel is proceeded by another vowel.

Vowels are arbitrary marks and symbols inscribed underneath the consonant that precedes them.

# Phonology

## Consonants

21 total

m
n
ng
ch - gh
s - z
sh - zh
th - dh
h
j
l (only inflectionary)
r/t (flapped 'r' sound between vowels, liquid after consonant)
l (only in sandhi and at the start of roots)
rr (only in sandhi)
f - v
w - wh

## Vowels

ii (= ee) (+r) (here)
y (= French y) (+ r) (yeah...)
a (= ah) (+ r)  (arrr, matey)
e (= eh) (+ r) (where)
u (= however Paul Hollywood says the 'o' in 'sponge') (+ r)
o (= oh without rounding) (+ r) (more)
oo (= ooo) (+ r) (sewer)
i
ae

## Dipthongs

e-ii
a-ii
o-ii
e-oo
a-oo
o-oo => ii-oo

## Coloration

All vowels monophthongs have an r-colored, l-colored, and nasal-colored variant, except for *i* and *ae*.

## Syllable construction

(I)V(T)

R-colored vowels followed by another vowel are not permissible, or always analyzed as (C)VrV

- V = all vowels and dipthongs
- I = consonants - (ng, ch, gh)
- T = consonants - (h, j, r, w, wh, l)

R-colored, l-colored and nasal-colored vowels are **only** used for inflectionary purposes.
The vowels *i* and *ae* cannot appear in roots anywhere where they might become an r-, l-, or nasal-colored vowel.
Nasals can only begin a root, never appear as a part.

## Slides

1. *-rt-* ==> *-rr-* rolled
2. *-lt-* ==> *-lr-* the r is not tapped, but rather liquid
3. *-ll-* ==> *-ll-* Welsh 'll'

# Affixes

All noun roots end in a vowel, which specifies the class. Nouns roots also must have at least 2 syllables.

## Noun Marking

Noun phonotactic rules:
1. Second syllable may not start with a nasal
2. If the first syllable starts with *r* or *l*, the second syllable cannot

1. Plural (type affix): default singular + (zero, some, many, most, all)
    1. singular = unmarked
    2. zero = *l-* + final root vowel
    3. some = *m-* + final root vowel
    4. many = *n-* + final root vowel
    5. most = *ng-* + final root vowel
    6. all = *r-* + final root vowel
2. Morphosyntactic (type infix): default patientive + (agentive, receptive (He gave a book *to me*), benefactive, causative, instrumental)
    1. patientive = unmarked
    2. agentive = end of first root vowel sequence colored *r*
    3. receptive = end of first root vowel sequence colored *l*
    4. benefactive = end of first root vowel sequence colored *m*
    5. causative = end of first root vowel sequence colored *n*
    6. instrumental = end of first root vowel sequence colored *ng*
3. Definiteness (type prefix): default indefinite unspecific + (a (particular), the, this, that)
    1. a, nonparticular = unmarked
    2. the = last root vowel colored *r*
    3. this = last root vowel colored *m*
    4. that = last root vowel colored *n*
    5. yon = last root vowel colored *ng*
    6. which/what = last root vowel colored *l*

Quirk: instead of saying "I'm looking for a girl with red hair", having a particular girl in mind, one would
say, "I'm looking for this girl with red hair".

## Pronoun Marking

1. Plural: default singular + (zero, some, many, most, all)
2. Morphosyntactic: default patientive + (agentive, receptive, benefactive, causative)

Marking is the same as nouns, except for pronouns there's no definiteness.

Pronouns vary in the root by:
1. Person (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
2. Sex in the 3rd (he, she, mix, inan)

*caī* = 'I'             *caīnun* = 'none of us'        *caīrnun* = 'none of us (agt.)'
*dhī* = 'you'           *dhīnun* = 'none of you'       *dhīrnun* = 'none of you (agt.)'
*zhe* = 'he'            *zhenun* = 'none of them'      *zhernun* = 'none of them (agt.)'
*ije* = 'she'           *ijenun* = 'none of them'      *ijernun* = 'none of them (agt.)'
*zao* = 'mix'           *zaonun* = 'none of them'      *zaornun* = 'none of them (agt.)'
*ate* = nonspecified    *atenun* = 'none of them'      *aternun* = 'none of them (agt.)'

## Interrogative Words

There are not specific interrogative words. Instead, some common ones may be constructed with
the *which/what* definiteness affix.

1. where - *which place*
2. why - *which reason*
3. what - *which thing/item*
4. who - *which person*
5. when - *which time*
6. how - *which process/method/path*

## Verb Marking

Verbs come in 3 classes: front, middle, and back. These correspond to the ending consonants:

1. Front = *-f*, *-v*, *-th*, *-dh*
2. Middle = *-s*, *-z*, *-sh*, *-zh*
3. Back = *-c*, *-g*

Verbs must have either *e*, *a*, or *o* as the final vowel.

1. Evidentiality: default participatory + (witness, inferential, hearsay, authoritative/quotative, faith)
    1. witness = final root consonant + confidence *-r*
    2. inferential = final root consonant + confidence + *-l*
    3. hearsay = final root consonant + confidence + *-m*
    4. authoritative/quotative = final root consonant + confidence + *-ng*
    5. faith = final root consonant + confidence + *-n*
2. Confidence: default participatory + (certain, confident, unsure)
    1. certain = *-ae-*
    2. confident = *-i-*
    3. unsure = *-y-*
2. Primary aspect: default perfective + (imperfective)
    1. imperfective = final root vowel + complementary nasal (front = *m*, middle = *n*, back = *ng*)
3. Secondary aspects: default none + (inchoative, cessative)
    1. inchoative = final root vowel + *-r-* + primary aspect
    2. cessative = final root vowel + *-l-* + primary aspect
4. Moods:
    1. indicative = default
    2. exhortative "should" = *-w* + ii-diphthonged final root vowel
    3. permissive "may" = *-r* + ii-diphthonged final root vowel
    4. conditional "would" = *-l* + ii-diphthonged final root vowel
    5. desiderative "want" = *-r* + oo-diphthonged final root vowel
    6. abilitive "can" = *-l* + oo-diphthonged final root vowel
    7. tentative "might" = *-w* + oo-diphthonged final root vowel

### Non-finite Forms

There are two non-finite forms: gerund and participle. The gerund form may be inflected like a noun. The participle form may be inflected like an adjective.

- Gerund: root + *-j* + final root vowel
- Participle: root + *-h* + final root vowel

- A present participle can be formed with the pertingent preposition + gerund
- A past participle can be formed with the subessive preposition + gerund
- A future participle can be formed with the superessive preposition + gerund

## Adjective/Adverb Marking

All adjectives and adverbs end in a consonant, and have at least two syllables in the root.

1. Comparative: default no-comparison + (least cool, less cool, more cool, most cool, as cool as, more cool than, less cool than, -ish)
    1. -ish = *-i*
    2. less = l-colored final vowel
    3. more = r-colored final vowel
    4. least = l-colored final vowel + *-ishī*
    5. most = r-colored final vowel + *-ishī*
    6. as ... as = *-ae*
    7. less ... than = l-colored final vowel + *-aedhī*
    8. more ... than = r-colored final vowel + *-aedhī*

# Expressing Tense
