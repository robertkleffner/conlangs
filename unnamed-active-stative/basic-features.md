# Basic desires for the language

1. Split-S active-stative alignment with active being default in intransitive, patientive used to specify voltion/effects
2. Purely 'fricafluid' consonant inventory (e.g. no stops)
3. Verbs heavily agglutinative, but nouns only lightly
4. Heavy reliance on spatial prepositions
5. Generally AVP word order (agent-verb-patient) in basic prose
6. Avalent verbs are frowned upon, e.g. don't say *It rains* but rather *The rain falls*

# Writing System

Consonants form the background and are based on geologic/geographical features:
1. The iconic peak (smooth sides)
2. The snowcapped iconic peak (smooth sides)
3. The craggy peak (bumpy sides)
4. The snowcapped craggy peak (bumpy sides)
5. The butte (bumpy sides)
6. The hill
7. The spire
8. The canyon
9. The two-point peak
10. The three-point peak
11. The balanced rock
12. The volcano
13. The rolling hills
14. The plateau
15. The arch
16. The cave
17. The valley
18. The terrace
19. The erupting volcano
20. The saddle
21. The dunes

Sometimes, an extra 'consonant' that has no vocalization called 'The Plain', is used in writing. This occurs when a vowel is proceeded by another vowel.

Vowels are arbitrary marks and symbols inscribed underneath the consonant that precedes them.

# Phonology

## Consonants

21 total

m
n
ng
c - g
s - z
sh - zh
th - dh
h
j
l (only inflectionary)
r/t (flapped 'r' sound between vowels, liquid after consonant)
ll (only in sandhi and at the start of roots)
rr (only in sandhi)
f - v
w - wh

## Vowels

ī (= ee) (+r) (here)
y (= French y) (+ r) (yeah...)
a (= ah) (+ r)  (arrr, matey)
e (= eh) (+ r) (where)
u (= however Paul Hollywood says the 'o' in 'sponge') (+ r)
o (= oh without rounding) (+ r) (more)
ū (= oo) (+ r) (sewer)
i
ae

## Dipthongs

e-ii
a-ii
o-ii
e-oo
a-oo
o-oo => ii-oo

## Coloration

All vowels monophthongs have an r-colored, l-colored, and nasal-colored variant, except for *i* and *ae*.

## Syllable construction

(I)V(T)

R-colored vowels followed by another vowel are not permissible, or always analyzed as (C)VrV

- V = all vowels and dipthongs
- I = consonants - (ng, c, g)
- T = consonants - (h, j, r, w, wh, l)

R-colored, l-colored and nasal-colored vowels are **only** used for inflectionary purposes.
The vowel *i* cannot appear in roots anywhere where they might become an r-, l-, or nasal-colored vowel.
Nasals can only begin a root, never appear as a part.

## Slides

1. *-rt-* ==> *-rr-* rolled
2. *-lt-* ==> *-lr-* the r is not tapped, but rather liquid
3. *-ll-* ==> *-ll-* Welsh 'll'

## Dialects

There are two primary phonological dialects. The first, 'airy', is the phonology described above, and generally considered more graceful and elegant.

The second, 'rocky', removes the fricativity from several consonants. It is considered workmanlike, but is also sometimes used in situations where greater auditory clarity is needed. The changes are listed below:
1. *c*: becomes a stop, essentially *k* in English
2. *g*: becomes a stop, essentially *g* in English
3. *t*: becomes a stop, essentially *t* in English
4. *d*: becomes a stop, essentially *d* in English
5. *f*: becomes a stop, essentially *p* in English
6. *v*: becomes a stop, essentially *b* in English

There exist variations of dialects in between the two.

# Affixes

All noun roots end in a vowel, which specifies the class. Nouns roots also must have at least 2 syllables.

## Noun Marking

Noun phonotactic rules:
1. Second syllable may not start with a nasal
2. If the first syllable starts with *r* or *l*, the second syllable cannot

1. Plural (type affix): default singular + (zero, some, many, most, all)
    1. singular = unmarked
    2. zero = *l-* + final root vowel
    3. some = *m-* + final root vowel
    4. many = *n-* + final root vowel
    5. most = *ŋ-* + final root vowel
    6. all = *r-* + final root vowel
2. Morphosyntactic (type infix): default patientive + (agentive, receptive (He gave a book *to me*), authoritative, causative, instrumental)
    1. patientive = unmarked
    2. agentive = end of first root vowel sequence colored *r*
    3. receptive = end of first root vowel sequence colored *l*
    4. authoritative = end of first root vowel sequence colored *m*
    5. causative = end of first root vowel sequence colored *n*
    6. instrumental/comitative/vialis = end of first root vowel sequence colored *ŋ*
3. Definiteness (type prefix): default indefinite unspecific + (a (particular), the, this, that)
    1. a, nonparticular = unmarked
        * like English, sometimes indefinite is used for gnomic aspect as well
    2. the = last root vowel colored *r*
    3. this = last root vowel colored *m*
    4. that = last root vowel colored *n*
    5. yon = last root vowel colored *ŋ*
    6. which/what = last root vowel colored *l*
4. Topological (type suffix): default none + (peak, basin, saddle)
    1. peak = *-c-* + last root vowel + definiteness
    2. basin = *-s-* + last root vowel + definiteness
    3. saddle = *-v-* + last root vowel + definiteness

Quirk: instead of saying "I'm looking for a girl with red hair", having a particular girl in mind, one would
say, "I'm looking for this girl with red hair". The indefinite cannot introduce a new, specific noun.

Quirk: 'indefinite' paired with 'all' as a subject functions as a type of gnomic aspect, e.g. 'All men die'

Authoritative = "according to", "he said", used with authoritative/quotative evidentiality

## Pronoun Marking

1. Plural: default singular + (zero, some, many, most, all)
2. Morphosyntactic: default patientive + (agentive, receptive, authoritative, causative, instrumental)

Marking is the same as nouns, except for pronouns there's no definiteness.

Pronouns vary in the root by:
1. Person (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
2. Sex in the 3rd (he, she, mix, inan)

*caī* = 'I'
*dī* = 'you'
*jei* = 'he'
*hy* = 'she'
*noi* = 'mix'
*onoi* = nonspecified

## Interrogative Words

There are not specific interrogative words. Instead, some common ones may be constructed with
the *which/what* definiteness affix.

1. where - *which place*
2. why - *which reason*
3. what - *which thing/item*
4. who - *which person*
5. when - *which time*
6. how - *which process/method/path*

## Verb Marking

Verbs come in 3 classes: front, middle, and back. These correspond to the ending consonants:

1. Front = *-f*, *-v*, *-t*, *-d*
2. Middle = *-s*, *-z*, *-š*, *-ž*
3. Back = *-c*, *-g*

1. Evidentiality: (witness, inferential, hearsay, authoritative/quotative, faith)
    1. witness = final root consonant + confidence *-r*
    2. inferential = final root consonant + confidence + *-l*
    3. hearsay = final root consonant + confidence + *-m*
    4. authoritative/quotative/narrative = final root consonant + confidence + *-ŋ*
    5. faith = final root consonant + confidence + *-n*
2. Confidence: (certain, confident, unsure)
    1. confident = *-ao-*
    2. unsure = *-oi-*
    3. skeptical = *-y-*
2. Primary aspect: default perfective + (imperfective)
    1. imperfective = final root vowel + complementary nasal (front = *m*, middle = *n*, back = *ŋ*)
3. Secondary aspects: default none + (inchoative, cessative)
    1. inchoative = final root vowel + *-r-* + primary aspect
    2. cessative = final root vowel + *-l-* + primary aspect
4. Moods:
    1. indicative = default
    2. exhortative "should" = *wh-* + ī-diphthonged final root vowel
    3. permissive "may" = *r-* + ī-diphthonged final root vowel
    4. conditional "would" = *l-* + ī-diphthonged final root vowel
    5. desiderative "want" = *r-* + ū-diphthonged final root vowel
    6. abilitive "can" = *l-* + ū-diphthonged final root vowel
    7. tentative "might" = *wh-* + ū-diphthonged final root vowel

### Confidence and Evidentiality

The confidence and evidentiality markers allow for a wide amount of information to be conveyed in two simple markers, and they are both mandatory. There are some interesting combinations:

1. Most often, "hearsay" evidentiality should not be used with "confident" confidence, as it may give the listener reason to think the speaker is overly gullible or too trusting of rumors.
2. Using "witness" evidentiality with "skeptical" confidence will generally indicate a high level of surprise, so that the listener will think the speaker does not trust their own experience.
3. Be careful with the "faith" evidentiality and "certain" confidence. The combination is most frequently used in day-to-day speech by someone who is tired of arguing but refuses to capitulate.
4. The "authoritative" evidentiality is heavily used when telling a story that did not happen to the speaker, whether real or fictional. Works of fiction in the first person still make heavier use of "witness" evidentiality in the narration.

### Non-finite Forms

There are two non-finite forms: gerund and participle. The gerund form may be inflected like a noun. The participle form may be inflected like an adjective.

- Gerund: root + *-j* + final root vowel
- Participle: root + *-h* + final root vowel + *-ŋ*

With emotions and states of being, the gerund can often function as if it were not a verb, but refering to the state of mind/emotion itself. For example, 'to ask' has a gerund form that means 'curiosity', and 'to love' has a gerund form that means 'love', while both can also be translated effectively as 'asking' or 'loving'.

### Valence

Because the agentive, patientive, causative, and indirect are all marked separately, the language tends to play fast and loose with
valence without needing separate morphological markers, constructions, or even words. For instance, the verb sleep can be used in the normal
English intransitive sense with the patientive ("Sleep me" = I sleep) but also as a transitive verb ("I sleep him" = I put him to sleep)

## Adjective/Adverb Marking

1. Adjectifying nouns
    1. *ll-* + noun final root vowel - no comparison
    2. *ll-* + noun final root vowel + *-hi* - ish
    3. *ll-* + noun final root vowel + *-l* - less
    4. *ll-* + noun final root vowel + *-r* - more
    5. *ll-* + noun final root vowel + *-lihī* - least
    6. *ll-* + noun final root vowel + *-rihī* - most
    7. *ll-* + noun final root vowel + *-hae* - as ... as
    8. *ll-* + noun final root vowel + *-lohī* - less ... than
    9. *ll-* + noun final root vowel + *-rohī* - more ... than

2. Adverbifying verbs
    1. *rr-* + verb final root vowel - no comparison
    2. *rr-* + verb final root vowel + *-hi* - ish
    3. *rr-* + verb final root vowel + *-l* - less
    4. *rr-* + verb final root vowel + *-r* - more
    5. *rr-* + verb final root vowel + *-lihī* - least
    6. *rr-* + verb final root vowel + *-rihī* - most
    7. *rr-* + verb final root vowel + *-hae* - as ... as
    8. *rr-* + verb final root vowel + *-lohī* - less ... than
    9. *rr-* + verb final root vowel + *-rohī* - more ... than

The soft-spoken thief spoke softly.

1. *aemit* - future tense, 'will be walking', 'will walk'
2. *žeith* - past tense, 'was walking', 'walked'
