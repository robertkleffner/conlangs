# Basic desires for the language

1. Split-S active-stative alignment with active being default in intransitive, patientive used to specify voltion/effects
2. Purely 'fricafluid' consonant inventory (e.g. no stops)
3. Verbs heavily agglutinative, but nouns only lightly
4. Heavy reliance on spatial prepositions
5. Generally AVP word order (agent-verb-patient) in basic prose
6. Avalent verbs are frowned upon, e.g. don't say *It rains* but rather *The rain falls*

# Writing System

Consonants form the background and are based on geologic/geographical features:
1. The iconic peak (smooth sides)
2. The snowcapped iconic peak (smooth sides)
3. The craggy peak (bumpy sides)
4. The snowcapped craggy peak (bumpy sides)
5. The butte (bumpy sides)
6. The hill
7. The spire
8. The canyon
9. The two-point peak
10. The three-point peak
11. The balanced rock
12. The volcano
13. The rolling hills
14. The plateau
15. The arch
16. The cave
17. The valley
18. The terrace
19. The erupting volcano
20. The saddle
21. The dunes

Sometimes, an extra 'consonant' that has no vocalization called 'The Plain', is used in writing. This occurs when a vowel is proceeded by another vowel.

Vowels are arbitrary marks and symbols inscribed underneath the consonant that precedes them.

# Phonology

## Consonants

21 total

m
n
ng
ch - gh
s - z
sh - zh
th - dh
h
j
l (only inflectionary)
r/t (flapped 'r' sound between vowels, liquid after consonant)
l (only in sandhi and at the start of roots)
rr (only in sandhi)
f - v
w - wh

## Vowels

ii (= ee) (+r) (here)
y (= French y) (+ r) (yeah...)
a (= ah) (+ r)  (arrr, matey)
e (= eh) (+ r) (where)
u (= however Paul Hollywood says the 'o' in 'sponge') (+ r)
o (= oh without rounding) (+ r) (more)
oo (= ooo) (+ r) (sewer)
i

## Dipthongs

e-ii
a-ii
o-ii
e-oo
a-oo

## Coloration

All vowels monophthongs have an r-colored and l-colored variant, except for *i*.

## Syllable construction

(I)V(T)

R-colored vowels followed by another vowel are not permissible, or always analyzed as (C)VrV

V = all vowels and dipthongs
I = consonants - (ng, ch, gh)
T = consonants - (h, j, r, w, wh, l)

R-colored and l-colored vowels are **only** used for inflectionary purposes.
The vowel *i* cannot appear in roots anywhere where it might become an r- or l-colored vowel.
Roots never begin with *wh*.

## Slides

*-rt-* ==> *-rr-* rolled
*-lt-* ==> *-lr-* the r is not tapped, but rather liquid
*-ll-* ==> *-ll-* Welsh 'll'

# Affixes

All noun roots end in a vowel, which specifies the class. Nouns roots also must have at least 2 syllables, except for the special words for *peak*, *butte*, and *hill*. These are marked the same way as 

## Noun Marking

1. Plural (type affix): default singular + (zero, some, many, most, all)
    1. singular = unmarked
    2. zero = *-nung*
    3. some = *-mī*
    4. many = *-mo*
    5. most = *-ma*
    6. all = *-hūng*
2. Morphosyntactic (type infix): default patientive + (agentive, receptive (He gave a book *to me*), benefactive, causative)
    1. patientive = unmarked
    2. agentive = final root vowel colored *r*
    3. receptive = final root vowel colored *l*
    4. benefactive = end of first root vowel sequence + final root vowel colored *l*
    5. causative = end of first root vowel sequence + final root vowel colored *r*
3. Definiteness (type prefix): default indefinite + (the, this, that)
    1. a = unmarked
    2. the = *whu-,wh-*
    3. this = *li-,liwh-*
    4. that = *lo-,lowh-*
    5. which/what = *whil-*

Benefactive: action was done with someone in mind, for someone's benefit, or on someone's behalf
Receptive: all other indirect objects

### Subclass: Mountain/Peak/Hill/Butte/Other elevated geographical features related to hiking and climbing

These suffixes occur before the pluralizers. The order they occur in is as enumerated.

1. Estimated technicality (mandatory): easy, medium, hard = *-vī*, *-vo*, *-vaī*
2. Estimated arduousness (mandatory): easy, medium, hard = *-jī*, *-jo*, *-jaī*
3. Coolness/beauty factor (mandatory): lame, decent, cool dude = *-cī*, *-co*, *-caī*
4. Need ropes (optional) = *-thu*
5. Need snow/ice gear (optional) = *-wig*

## Pronoun Marking

1. Plural: default singular + (zero, some, many, most, all)
2. Morphosyntactic: default patientive + (agentive, receptive, benefactive, causative)

Marking is the same as nouns except for the benefactive and causative.

1. Benefactive = *-lu-*
2. Causative = *-tu-*

Pronouns vary in the root by:
1. Person (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
2. Sex in the 3rd (he, she, mix, inan)

*caī* = 'I'             *caīnung* = 'none of us'        *caīrnung* = 'none of us (agt.)'
*dhī* = 'you'           *dhīnung* = 'none of you'       *dhīrnung* = 'none of you (agt.)'
*zhe* = 'he'            *zhenung* = 'none of them'      *zhernung* = 'none of them (agt.)'
*ije* = 'she'           *ijenung* = 'none of them'      *ijernung* = 'none of them (agt.)'
*zao* = 'mix'           *zaonung* = 'none of them'      *zaornung* = 'none of them (agt.)'
*ate* = nonspecified    *atenung* = 'none of them'      *aternung* = 'none of them (agt.)'

## Interrogative Words

*wha* = 'where'
*whal* = 'why'
*whī* = 'what'
*who* = 'who/which'
*whao* = 'when'
*whar* = 'how'

*whī* and *who* follow the marking for pronouns.

## Verb Marking

All verb stems have at least 2 consonants except for the copula *soīvu*. There are three types of verb: *e*, *a*, and *o*.

1. Evidentiality: default witness/participatory + (inferential, hearsay, authoritative/quotative, faith)
    1. inferential = *-l*
    2. hearsay = *-r*
    3. authoritative/quotative = *-ng*
    4. faith = *-g*
2. Primary aspect: default stative/frequentative + (perfective, progressive)
    1. perfective = *-shi*
    2. progressive = *-thi*
3. Secondary aspects: default none + (inchoative, continuative, cessative)
    1. inchoative = *-feī*
    2. continuative = *-neū*
    3. cessative = *-vao*
4. Moods:
    1. indicative = *-e/-a/-o/*
    2. exhortative "should" = *-erhī/-arhī/-orhī*
    3. permissive "may" = *-ezze/-azza/-ozzo*
    4. conditional "would" = *-eī/-aī/-oī*
    5. desiderative "want" = *-erri/-arri/-orri*
    6. abilitive "can" = *-enzhe/-anzha/-onzho*
    7. tentative "might" = *-elle/-alla/-ollo*

Mood + primary + secondary + evidentiality

### Non-finite Forms

Each verb can be classified with it's gerund form according to three types.

2. Gerund
    1. type 1 = *-eīvu*
    2. type 2 = *-aīvu*
    3. type 3 = *-oīvu*

A present participle can be formed with the pertingent preposition + gerund
A past participle can be formed with the subessive preposition + gerund
A future participle can be formed with the superessive preposition + gerund
An infinitive can be formed with the inessive preposition + gerund

## Adjective/Adverb Marking

All adjectives end in a non-nasal consonant.
All adverbs end in a nasal consonant.

1. Comparative: default no-comparison + (least cool, less cool, more cool, most cool, as cool as, more cool than, less cool than, -ish)
    1. -ish = *-ly*
    2. less = l-colored final vowel
    3. more = r-colored final vowel
    4. least = l-colored final vowel + *-ishī*
    5. most = r-colored final vowel + *-oshī*
    6. as ... as = *-aoth*
    7. less ... than = l-colored final vowel + *-idhī*
    8. more ... than = r-colored final vowel + *-odhī*

# Derivational Morphology

1. Adjective -> Noun : "strong" -> "strength", names the quality = *-ummeī*
2. Verb -> Noun : "climb" -> "climber", subject performs the act = *-emra/-amra/-omra*
3. Adjective -> Noun : "evil" -> "enemy", subject has the quality = *-emra/-amra/-omra*
4. Noun -> Noun : "rock" -> "boulder", augmentative = *-ro*
5. Noun -> Noun : "rock" -> "pebble", diminutive = *-lī*
6. Verb -> Noun : "cut" -> "saw", tool used to speed up or assist in an act = *-ethra/-athra/-othra*
7. Noun -> Adjective : "water" -> "wet", having the quality of = *-lyth*
8. Verb -> Adjective : "fall" -> "unstable", liable to = *-efen/-afen/-ofen*
