## Confident imperfective intransitives.

Note that in indicative phrases that have a future tense, that the witness evidentiality implies foresight! For example, 'He is going to arrive soon (I am confident because I have seen it, likely in a vision)'. Many listeners will be skeptical.
It is most commmon to other evidentialities when discussing the future.

1. *Morsyr fuvensaor*
    * The sun is shining (I am confident because I have witnessed it).
2. *Morsyr fuvensaol*
    * The sun is shining (I am confident because I have seen evidence that allowed me to infer it.)
    * Warning: your evidence better be good if questioned, since you used the confident marker
3. *Morsyr fuvensaom*
    * The sun is shining (I am confident because I heard indirectly that it is).
    * Warning: you are giving license to the listener to see you as gullible or easily led by rumor
4. *Morsyr fuvensaoŋ*
    * The sun is shining (I am confident because I heard it directly).
    * This one indicates a high degree of trust in the source on the part of the speaker
5. *Morsyr fuvensaon*
    * The sun is shining (I am confident because I have faith)
    * This combination of confidence and evidentiality can indicate subjective, experiential evidence that is unrelated to any particular event that was witnessed, e.g. 'He will arrive soon (I am confident because I know him to be reliable)'. It also pops up frequently in discussions of religion and morality (many speakers fervently believe opposing ideologies, but most will maintain an overarching respect for evidentiality).

## Unsure imperfective intransitives.

The 'Unsure' confidence level generally describes an ambiguous confidence in whether the action has happened, will happen, or is happening.

1. *Morsyr fuvensoir*
    * The sun is shining (I am unsure, I think I saw it).
2. *Morsyr fuvensoil*
    * The sun is shining (I am unsure but I've seen more evidence that makes it likely than I've seen against it).
3. *Morsyr fuvensoim*
    * The sun is shining (I am unsure, I heard it indirectly).
4. *Morsyr fuvensoiŋ*
    * The sun is shining (I am unsure, but someone told me).
    * This one is basically non-committal reportative, and is often used in journalism to maintain an air of being 'un-biased', particularly when reporting on claims made by public figures.
5. *Morsyr fuvensoin*
    * The sun is shining (I don't know why, but something tells me it is).
    * All uses of the faith evidentiality imply that the speaker has some amount of confidence in the statement. The confidence marker then becomes varying levels of acknowledgement that the statement is unlikely to be believed by the listener.

## Skeptical imperfective intransitives.

The 'Skeptical' confidence level generally describes a statement that the speaker does not believe is accurate, or has low confidence.

1. *Morsyr fuvensyr*
    * The sun is shining (I saw it, but I don't believe my eyes)
    * This one is tricky, and generally used for when the speaker believes they have false memories or hallucinations.
2. *Morsyr fuvensyl*
    * The sun is shining (I've seen the evidence, but I'm not at all convinced)
    * Often used when repeating what a colleague one disagrees with has said. As a result, ripe for abuse in op-eds, particularly about politics.
3. *Morsyr fuvensym*
    * The sun is shining (They say! But why believe them?)
4. *Morsyr fuvensyŋ*
    * The sun is shining (I heard it, but the person who told me is untrustworthy)
